Design a distributed key value caching system, like Memcached or Redis.

1) Features
This is the first part of any system design interview, coming up with the 
features which the system should support. As an interviewee, you should try to 
list down all the features you can think of which our system should support. 
Try to spend around 2 minutes for this section in the interview. 
You can use the notes section alongside to remember what you wrote. 

Q) Q: What is the amount of data that we need to cache? 
A: Let's assume we are looking to cache on the scale of Google or Twitter. 
The total size of the cache would be a few TBs.
