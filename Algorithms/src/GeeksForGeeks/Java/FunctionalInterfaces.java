A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces.
Before Java 8, we had to create anonymous inner class objects or implement these interfaces.
