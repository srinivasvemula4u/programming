 * Pairwise sum of n (where n >= 3) numbers are given in a specified order, 
 * find the numbers. The order has pair sum of first and second, then first 
 * and third, first and fourth, â€¦ second and third, second and fourth, .. 
 * and so on. Consider an example: n = 4, let the numbers be {a, b, c, d}, 
 * their pairwise sum is given in the order 
 * arr[] = {a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d}.

Examples:

Input  : arr[] = {11, 18, 13, 13, 8, 5}
Output : {8, 3, 10, 5}
8+3 = 11, 8+10 = 18, 8+5 = 13, 3+10 = 13,
3+5 = 8, ...

Input  : arr[] = {13, 10, 14, 9, 17, 21, 
                  16, 18, 13, 17}
Output : {3, 10, 7, 11, 6}
