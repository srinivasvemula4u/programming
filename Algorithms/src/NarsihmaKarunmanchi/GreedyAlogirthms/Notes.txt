Greedy Applications 
1) Sorting : Selection Sort, Topological Sort
2) Priority Queues : Heap Sort
3) Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm
4) Prim's and Kuskal Algorithms
5) Shortest path in weighted graph(Dijkstra's)
6)Coin Change problem
7) Fractional Knapsack problem
8) Disjoin sets union by size and union by height (rank)
9) Job scheduling algorithms
10) Greedy algorithms can be used as approximation algorithm for complex problems.
