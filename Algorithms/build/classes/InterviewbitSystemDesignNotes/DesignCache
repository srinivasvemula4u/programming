Design a distributed key value caching system, like Memcached or Redis.

1) Features
This is the first part of any system design interview, coming up with the 
features which the system should support. As an interviewee, you should try to 
list down all the features you can think of which our system should support. 
Try to spend around 2 minutes for this section in the interview. 
You can use the notes section alongside to remember what you wrote. 

Q) Q: What is the amount of data that we need to cache? 
A: Let's assume we are looking to cache on the scale of Google or Twitter. 
The total size of the cache would be a few TBs.

Q: What should be the eviction strategy? 
A: It is possible that we might get entries when we would not have space to 
accommodate new entries. In such cases, 
we would need to remove one or more entries to make space for the new entry.
