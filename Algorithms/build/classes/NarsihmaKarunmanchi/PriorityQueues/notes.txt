Main Priority Queue Operations

1) Insert(Key,data): Inserts data with key to the priority queue. Elements are ordered based on key

2) Delete Min/ Delete Max: Remove and return the element with the smallest / largest key

3) Get Minumum /Get Maximum: Return the element with the smallest/ largest key

Auxilary Priority Queues Operations

1) kth- Smallest / Kth -Largest: Returns the kth Smallest / Kth Largest key in priority queue.
2) Size: Returns the number of elements in priority queue
3) Heap Sort: Sorts the elements in the priority queue based on priority

Applications 
1) Data Compression : Huffman Coding algorithm
2) Shortest Path algorithm : Dijkstra's Algorithm
3) Minimum Spanning tree algorithm : Prim's Algorithm
4) Event - Driven Simulation: Customers in a line
5) Selection problem : Finding kth smallest element.
