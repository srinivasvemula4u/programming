/*Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, 
it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal 
string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
Example 1:

Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
Example 2:

Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"

/*
Basic idea: each time we take a look at the last four digits of
            binary verion of the input, and maps that to a hex char
            shift the input to the right by 4 bits, do it again
            until input becomes 0.
