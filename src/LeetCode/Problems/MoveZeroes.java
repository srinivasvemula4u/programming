Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the 
non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

    Approach #3 (Optimal) [Accepted]

The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. 
    For example, the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's n-1nâˆ’1 times, which is not necessary. We could have instead written just once. How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.

The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. 
    A simple realization is if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position or 
    a position earlier. If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, 
    which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the current position by 0 right away,so that unlike 
    the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.

In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:

All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current and slow pointer, 
    then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance current pointer.

With this invariant in-place, it's easy to see that the algorithm will work.
