Set Operations

MAKESET(X): Creates a new set containing a single element x
UNION(X,Y) : Creates a new set containing the elements X and Y with their union and deletes the sets containing the elements X and Y.
FIND(X) : Returns the name of the set containing the element X.

Operations:
1) To represent network connectivity
2) Image processing
3) To find least common ancestor
4) To define equivalence of finite state automata
5) Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm
6) In game algorithms 

Initial, all the elements are in separate equivalence classes.

1) Fast Find Implementation(Quick Find)
2) Fast Union Implementation (Quick Union

Fast Union Three types
1) Fast Union(Slow Find)
2) Fast Union(Quick Find) i) Union By Size(also called Union byy Weight)
ii) Union By height(also called Union by rank);
