i
≤
N
1≤i≤N such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that 
x
x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:
First line of input consists of an integer 
N
N denoting the number of elements in the array 
A
